## Concept

Vk-mini-app, a game by Dixy Retailer for users who want to win a price. 
The price is a coupon, that can be changed to a free product in BurgerKing.

User see the shelf with different products. He has to choose 1 item, click on product and see if there is a coupon under it.
Every user has only 1 move at the start, but can earn another by leaving comments, sharing and liking posts on dixy-vk page.
